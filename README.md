# Password Manager  
## Project Overview

This project is a Password Manager developed in Python as part of my Year 13 IB Computer Science Internal Assessment (IA).
The purpose of the project is to securely store and manage user passwords, providing an easy-to-use interface while maintaining high levels of security.

The Password Manager includes the following core features:

- Encrypted storage of passwords using symmetric encryption (Fernet from the cryptography library).

- Authentication system to ensure only the authorized user can access the passwords.

- Password generator to create strong and random passwords.

- Secure file handling, including a file hash to verify the system/login password.
